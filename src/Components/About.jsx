        Front-end web development focuses on creating the visual and interactive aspects of a website that users directly engage with. It involves using a combination of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality to build user interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also responsive and accessible across different devices and browsers. Front-end developers often utilize frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, and Vue.js to streamline the development process and enhance performance. Their work ensures a seamless user experience by optimizing loading times, implementing intuitive navigation, and ensuring compatibility with various web standardsâ€‹
